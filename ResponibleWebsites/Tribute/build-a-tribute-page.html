      <p id ="tribute-info">Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016) was more than just a boxing legend — he was a global icon of strength, courage, and conviction. Known as "The Greatest," Ali was celebrated not only for his unmatched skills in the ring but also for his bold personality, poetic trash talk, and fearless activism.

Ali won the world heavyweight boxing title three times and secured 56 wins in his professional career, including iconic bouts like the "Rumble in the Jungle" and the "Thrilla in Manila." But his impact extended far beyond sports. In 1967, he refused to be drafted into the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, citing religious and moral objections. This decision cost him his titles and boxing license, but it made him a symbol of resistance and integrity.

Throughout his life, Muhammad Ali championed civil rights, stood up against injustice, and inspired millions with his unwavering belief in himself. He once said, “I hated every minute of training, but I said, Don’t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.’” His words, like his legacy, continue to resonate around the world.

Even after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 1984, Ali remained active in humanitarian efforts and used his fame to promote peace, understanding, and compassion. He was a man of principle, passion, and perseverance — a true champion inside and outside the ring.</p>
